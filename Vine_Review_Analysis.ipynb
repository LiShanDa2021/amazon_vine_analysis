If you ever had a well you would understand the need to know where it is. Especially in the winter should you ever have a problem. So when i received it i tried to find the well using logic to where it came out of the basement. No luck so i jus went random from house out and when i hit some signals i marked them. I went back to the signals and fount the strongest on and started digging. apx 16&#34; down i dound the well cap. I also used it when the contractor that was replacing the sidewalks and steps to my house. The dimond cutter uses a lot of water and while cutting the steps off there was a ton of mud and water below the stems that were being cut off. The contractor lost a bolt out of his cutter and was stopped. He looked for it but could not find it. I went and got the metal detector and within a minute i located some metal and he reached down in the mud and pulled out theis 3&#34; long bolt. It paid for itsel just with those 2 times i needed it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

Really amazing results, way better than I had thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

We are planning an upcoming 5 day camping trip in our Windrider 17 trimaran sailboat in the Everglades National Park.  I was offered the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review...which I am providing.  So, this offer came at a good time.<br /><br />My wife cant use products containing Deet because they turn her skin red and hot; she sort of has a bad reaction to the Deet.  She has used the Greeneral PRO Insect Repellent several times around our house.  No bug issues...but the big thing is, she has actually found a product that works great and doesn't contain Deet. Also, you don't feel, and look, like a greased pig after applying it.  The scent is pleasant and mild.<br /><br />Please see my video review.<br /><br /> This stuff is expensive...but it appears that a little goes a long way!

Measures 4.5 X 4 and has a great grip with six teeth on each Bear Paw. The claws are longer and wider than most can fit a glove on if need be, can handle 40 pounds in 20 minutes shredding your large quantity of meat. The claw measures 1.5 inches long.  Material is plastic FDA approved. Dishwasher safe.<br /><br />Directions use one claw to hold the meat and the other claw to do the shredding.  Great for handling any thing hot in the kitchen instead of your hands.  The claw points can be sharp and grabs the meat easier than a fork due to the size of the claws.<br /><br />We back up all our products with an unconditional 1 year warranty so ordering again with us will always be hassle free and an overall great experience!  IF FOR SOME REASON THE CLAWS BECOME DEFECTIVE WILL STAND BEHIND AND SEND ANOTHER.<br /><br />I would recommend these claws for any occasion, and can be transported easily withfor cook out or camping.  And for fun great &#34;bear claws&#34; make a good costume..<br /><br />I received this item at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbaised review.<br /><br />Product Link;[[ASIN:B00XQKYYYE Best BBQ Meat Claws Shredder Bear Claw Tool Carving Fork Meat Handing Claw- Meat Claws and Shredder for Pulled Pork, Shredded Chicken, Beef, Barbacoa, Carnitas- MUST HAVE for Grilling and Kitchen Use]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |2015-08-31 |\n",

I have replaced it twice and followed all directions, even talked to customer service and they couldn't help us. You cant replace the grate with anything but this brand/size either. I don't know how anyone uses this more than a few times without rust in their food. If there's a secret I'm all ears! Otherwise, we are looking for a new grill. Complete waste of money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

We have had it now for about two weeks. Came shipped perfect. My only concern is that after only two weeks it seems that the yarn at the top supports are beginning to stretch a bit more on one side than the other - so it continues to lean to one side. I will keep an eye on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |2015-08-31 |\n",

The faint pleasant odor after application lasts only about an hour and smells like there's an Italian restaraunt down the street baking garlic bread. We have used this product for almost ten years and it's outstanding and NOT toxic on the yard to kids and pets etc. We let it dry a little while before letting everyone back out.

My favorite would be to use them in an open box design aimed at a disco mirror ball. Always have a cool lighting effect indoors and out.

If he sold lasers he would mention the facts of laser ratings and say that this laser is well within the safe for everything and everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2015-08-31 |\n",

They do need some assembly, though it's very simple and quick.  I waited for the lawn to be pretty damp from a couple days of rain before I tried these out.<br /><br />They do work pretty well.  I found pockets of soil that were harder than others, which made my foot roll slightly during walking back and fourth with the aerating sandals on.  Most of the time the spikes penetrated the surface fully, but occasionally hit harder soil which required some more stomping.  For a frame of reference, i'm 205 lbs... Lighter persons may have to exert more effort, depending on their soil composition.  Lifting the sandals back out of the soil did require a little bit of effort, probably equivalent to 10-20lbs of pulling force to pull them back out in the harder soils, and almost not noticeable in the softer soils.<br /><br />I'll have to wait to see the results, but as far as use goes, they do what they say.  The straps are a bit long, and i'll need to cut them down to a better size.  I've tried this before with crampons and those didn't work so well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |2015-08-31 |\n",

If this thing was made of metal instead of cheap plastic, I would LOVE it. It's a real shame. It was on the faucet for just a two weeks, in the shade, and only used every third day. Then it broke right off when I went out to use it :( I was sad. I think I will try to make one myself out of metal or shop around for a metal one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

I was accepting a package from UPS when the driver (standing a good ways away from my porch) told me I had a hornets nest just under my doorway. I looked down and saw a small swarm of four or five hornets. I'd noticed one or two underneath my screen door, but had no idea what they were doing. Well, after the delivery guys left, I grabbed the Raid House & Garden spray and went at the hornets. I noticed it had very little effect. So, I told my grandson to bring me the Ortho Bed Bug Killer. I'd been battling bed bugs and it seemed to have a great effect because we hadn't had bites in over a week. Long story short, every hornet that I sprayed with the Ortho hit the deck right away. One spray and they were down. I followed up with a little more and that was it. They squirmed a bit, but they died dang near instantly. With the Raid they squirmed and danced around, some even got up and flew off. Those that died took quite a while and a lot more spraying. That Ortho? No way. Knocked them right out. Now that's some good stuff. I don't even think it said anything about wasps. But, it took them babies out. Anything that works better than Raid on insects that Raid's designed to kill gets an A++ in my book. I also use Ortho Home Defense yearly for household insects indoors and outdoors and will continue to do so. For around $13 I get a virtually bug free environment in my home and basement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2015-08-31 |\n",

This panel is rated at 100 Watts. That means that its instantaneous output approaches 100 W if there are no clouds in the way and if an imaginary line drawn from the panel to the sun makes a 90 degree angle with imaginary lines drawn on the glass from top to bottom and side to side. Since no one is going to buy an expensive alt-azimuth mount to keep the panel perfectly pointed, its output will be considerably less than 100 Watts for most of the day, so if you're going to use it to directly power something while the sun is shining, its power requirement should be a lot less than 100.<br />This panel's max voltage is about 18 Volts DC. DC means direct current, which is what comes out of a car battery. You may be planning to use it to recharge a battery. My Costco RV battery has a capacity of 115 amp-hours, so at 50% discharge I would have to put 57.5 amp-hours back into it. Since Watts = Volts x Amps and since I can't recharge a 12 V battery at much more than 14 V, the most recharge current you can get out of this panel is about 7 Amps. At that rate it would take more than 8 hours of direct sun under perfect conditions to recharge a battery. Since you'll probably just lay the panel flat on the ground or prop it up somewhere, expect to wait 2 or 3 sunny days to fully recharge an RV battery. By the way, if you do plan to recharge a 12 V battery (or power some 12 V appliance), you will have to connect it through a charge controller (not included) to keep the output voltage below the 18 V operating level.<br />Some of you want to know if you can use this panel to run your house appliances like a refrigerator. Since everything you plug in at home requires a constant supply of alternating current (AC) at 110-120 Volts, you will need to store the panel's DC output in a battery and then get an inverter to convert 12 V DC to 120 V AC. You may be wondering how long an RV battery can run a refrigerator. My LG fridge uses 864 Watts when its compressor is running. A typical combination of inverter and solar panel is less than 90% efficient, so let's assume the inverter needs to pull 980 Watts out of the battery to run the fridge. An inverter putting that big a load on a 12 V RV battery draws about 75 amps, so it could only run the fridge's compressor for 3/4 of an hour before the battery would become 50% discharged again. Rather than wait another 2 or 3 days to recharge, consider getting more panels.<br />A word about inverters: You need to get a short length of some pretty thick wire to connect an inverter to a battery. A 2000-watt inverter can pull up to 150 Amps which would melt ordinary house wire. You also need to get an inverter that is rated at significantly more than your anticipated load if electric motors are involved. This is because a motor causes a surge in power when it first starts up. It only settles down to its rated power draw after it gets going.ow long an RV battery can run a refrigerator. My LG fridge uses 864 Watts when its compressor is running. A typical combination of inverter and solar panel is less than 90% efficient, so let's assume the inverter needs to pull 980 Watts out of the battery to run the fridge. An inverter putting that big a load on a 12 V RV battery draws about 75 amps, so it could only run the fridge's compressor for 3/4 of an hour before the battery would become 50% discharged again. Rather than wait another 2 or 3 days to recharge, consider getting more panels.<br />A word about inverters: You need to get a short length of some pretty thick wire to connect an inverter to a battery.

I was a little skeptical when I received it and realized that it wasn't all one piece.  The suction cup screws into a back plate/support that you put on the window.  The container with the feeding ports then rests on the back plate using two small prongs; the container doesn't snap into place or anything.  I'm worried that an empty container might be blown off the support by a strong wind, but decided to give it a shot first.  Once I secured the back plate to the the window and filled the container, it seemed to sit nicely and the plate supports it pretty well.  The added weight from the nectar definitely helps hold it in place.<br />The suction cup is holding strong even with a breeze.  Time will tell if it continues to hold well, so I'll update this review if something happens.<br /><br />Otherwise, after filling it last night I have already had several little visitors today!  The resting perch is nice since they stay longer, and they have been fine with me sitting by my window as long as I don't make sudden movements.  Even as I'm writing this review, one came up for a snack!<br /><br />For the moment, this seems to be a great product!  I will update in a couple of weeks if anything changes.<br /><br />UPDATE: This update is a bit late, but I thought it would be good to make some notes:<br />-This feeder is blast. I got tons of visitors to my window.<br />-My previous concern about a strong wind knocking it down was answered in a very positive way: it was still hanging on strong through 2 days over heavy rain and wind! And it didnt fall all during the winter months when we had a lot of heavy rain and strong winds every couple days.<br />-My roommate loved it so much that when I moved out I left it for her to enjoy. I plan to get another one in the near future :) Last time I contacted her she stated that her new roommate was loving having all the visitors to her window.<br />----<br /><br />NOTE:  Don't bother buying pre-made Nectar.  It's a waste of money and the red dye is not good for the birds.  You can make your own by simply dissolving 1/4 cup sugar in 1 cup water (you only need half that much for this feeder, so 1/8 cup sugar to 1/2 cup water).  I just used filtered water in my tea kettle and used a mug to stir in the sugar.  No need to clean up a pot!uring the winter months when we had a lot of heavy rain and strong winds every couple days.<br />-My roommate loved it so much that when I moved out I left it for her to enjoy.

I would definitely recommend this liner!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |2015-08-31 |\n",

Does this Char-Broil give it some competition?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Running at about $30 cheaper than the Weber, the Char-Broil top feature over Weber is that it claims to perform more even cooking.  Generally, this hasn't been a problem for me with the Weber because I simply move the meat around adjusting to hot spots.  But it someone is newer to grilling or doesn't want to watch the meat as much, the Char-Broil does indeed to a better job in this department.  Char-Broil as claims to need less coal but I didn't do a scientific measurement on this claim comparing the temperatures of the two grills.  Coal is very cheap so this is only a minor, but welcomed advantage.<br /><br />Char-Broils porcelain grate puts Weber's to shame.  I've always thought Weber's grate looks extremely cheap, but it does get the job done despite being prone to rust if ever accidentally exposed to water.  The only advantage Weber's grate has over Char-Broil are hinged sides so that you can easily add more coals while cooking.  I rarely need to add more coals, but having this feature is helpful for the few times you do need it.<br /><br />There are two other notable differences.  First, let's talk about the handles.  Weber has a handle on the top and two on the side.  I find this more natural and easier to use.  Although not frequently done, how are you going to move the Char-Broil once it is hot?  And with Weber having side handles on the base, Weber provides a spot to hang your grill tools.  There is no such place on the Char-Broil which is odd in this day and age.  Weber also has a vent off-centered which allows you a little freedom in moving the vent around if you prefer it not over the meat.  On the Char-Broil, the top vent is in the center so rotating the lid won't give you any variance.<br /><br />If I had to buy a new charcoal kettle grill, I am not sure which one I would buy.  I might buy this Char-Broil because I am starting to resent some of Weber's inflated prices and cheap grates.  On the other hand, I know what I am getting with a Weber, and I know that it will last.  Congrats then to Char-Broil then for making me pause before buying a Weber.ing to resent some of Weber's inflated prices and cheap grates.

It's big enough to fit over my rectangle table and chairs that seat six with some room to spare.  The drawstrings on the bottom of the cover allow a closer fit and there are two anchors for securing the cover to the table.  It has a waterproof backing but it doesn't seem as well made as the Classic Accessories Ravenna cover I purchased recently.  I think the light color of this cover will show dirt very quickly which will have it looking very weathered after a winter.  If I had to choose between this cover and the one from Classic Accessories, I think I'd spring for the extra $10 or so and buy the Classic Accessories brand.  The overall construction of that cover is better and it looks like it will last longer.

It's all self-contained. There is an on-off push switch in the bottom, but for the globe itself, you can't lose anything except the remote.<br />2. It's solar powered. No batteries to replace. I received it early afternoon and set it out on an overcast afternoon. As soon as it was dark it lit right up - not as brightly as the next day when it received a full charge in bright sunlight, but still...<br />3. It floats - the bottom is slightly flattened and weighted, so the globe will sit nicely on a patio or table (or any flat surface) but it's been floating around in our pool for a few days and is no worse for the water exposure - the seams for the bottom (containing the battery-light assembly) are well put together.<br />4. It has 5 different &#34;modes&#34; meaning basically colors. It would be nice if one mode was flashing between the lights!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Unless you're decorating a small, confined area and have easily entertained family and friends, one globe has a pretty limited purpose. ALL of the promotional photos and videos I've seen of the GalaxyGLO show five at a time, demonstrating the different modes, but also demonstrating that if you really want to get your outdoor soiree attendees to go &#34;WOW!&#34; you're going to need several of these, and that adds up unless you have deep pockets.<br />2. The size and shape suggest &#34;pool volleyball&#34; and kids will treat it as such if you allow it - Grandson hasn't damaged ours yet, but... it almost asks to be hit around during the day (and if you put it away, it's not charging.)<br /><br />Revised from 4 stars to 2: After a few days we had rain. Not particularly heavy rain - just rain. This globe, designed to stay outdoors to absorb sunshine and water-proof enough to float in the pool, had water accumulated inside. From that moment on the lighting system became totally inoperable. It change from &#34;cool outdoor solar-powered light&#34; to &#34;not particularly attractive white plastic ball.&#34; I've never edited a Vine review before, but the extremely short

Charcoal/wood grilling is an art which takes experience to know how to control the heat and get your food cooked the way YOU like it.<br /><br />I love grilling on my Weber Kettle charcoal grill. It's simple: a two piece kettle, a grate for the charcoal, a grilling grate for the food, an ash catcher and wheels. It not only has temperature control on the lid but at the bottom as well. With your standard round heavy gauged wired grills you are cooking right over the fuel except where the grill touches the meat which gives you those beautiful grill marks. Because you are cooking right over the hot coals the outside of the meat will be crispy even though the inside can be raw or close to it. The Weber grilling grate has two sides to open so you can easily add more charcoal and/or smoking wood without removing the entire cooking grill. While there are similarities between the Weber Kettle and the Char Broil they are two different types of grills.<br /><br />The Char Broil is designed as an infrared grill which means the grate is heated to do the cooking. This actually makes a more even surface to cook on which the Char Broil kettle does very well.<br /><br />With the standard over the fuel grilling it's easy to cook the outside of the meat to a nice crisp leaving the inside close to raw. At about 600 degrees it can take about 8 minutes or less for a thick burger. At 8 minutes on the Char Broil the outside and the inside of the hamburgers I cooked looked the same and the outside wasn't crisp like I'm used to and the inside was not rare at all. And while I prefer my meat crispy on the outside and rare inside they were delicious!<br /><br />Only the top of the Char Broil gives you heat control, there is no way to close the holes on the side of the grill (the holes on the Weber come in at the bottom). One problem with this is I prefer to shut down the grill to stop the coals. Sometimes I use the leftover charcoal especially if I run out! But more important the less the grill is heated the longer it will last.<br /><br />The Char Broil cooking grate is one piece which makes it very difficult to add more charcoal or smoking wood. If you are doing slow cooking sometimes you need to add more fuel.<br /><br />The Weber has two handles, the Char Broil only one. I store the grills on our back porch so I need to carry them up - easier with two handles. The handle on the Char Broil is attached to the top - for good reason, to open the lid. Make sure the lid is locked shut before trying to move it...<br /><br />On the Char Broil the lid is attached and swings up to open - I absolutely love that! That is a major flaw with the Weber having to deal with the lid.<br /><br />There is a wire shelf on the bottom of the legs of the Char Broil to store the cooking grill. This is a great idea. I use a chimney starter so I have to remove the cooking grill and store it somewhere to start the charcoal.<br /><br />The holes on the top of the grill are huge which can give you better control over the heat.<br /><br />The Char Broil cooks evenly which is good but that means all the way through. Personally I prefer crispy meat over evenly cooked but my wife doesn't like hers as crispy.<br /><br />This does not come with a utensil holder but neither does the Weber.<br /><br />I've attached a simple video that shows what I go through to grill.<br /><br />Overall this is a wonderful addition to my outdoor cooking which will give me new options to experiment with. The hamburgers were fantastic but I will probably use my other grilling method for steaks.he grill to stop the coals. Sometimes I use the leftover charcoal especially if I run out!

We are so happy to return to charcoal grilling after 10 years of using a propane grill. The difference in food flavor is just amazing, and even more so with this Char-Broil Kettleman grill, since you can add hardwoods to flavor or smoke your foods as you grill.<br /><br />The grill comes unassembled, but it took less than an hour for my husband to set it up. He said instructions were clear, and he really liked the fact that all the nuts, bolts and screws were packaged and labelled individually, rather than all shoved together in a plastic bag. He said that alone made assembly easier than normal.<br /><br />Instructions for the grill are clear, and you really should take the time to read them. The grill has tiers to it, and you put your charcoal on the second tier, not on the bottom as we have in the past with older grills. There are vent holes on the top, which are handy to allow smoke out or to bring the temperature of the grill down. And there is a thermometer on the front of the grill to tell you what temperature the grill is running, which allows you to more precisely grill foods such as an entire roast or chicken.<br /><br />The grill is easy to clean, with a slide-out ash tray at the bottom. We use the storage shelf on the bottom to hold our charcoal chimney and charcoal, and keep a cover on it when not in use so neither will get wet. A cover is recommended to extend the life of the exterior of the grill. I also like the &#34;latch&#34; feature which keeps the cover closed securely. Even when not hot, this is a handy feature to keep the grandchildren from opening the grill.<br /><br />We are VERY happy to have this grill, and have given our propane grill away now. In just a few days we have grilled chicken, hamburgers and even used applewood in it to grill steaks. Every meal was delicious. We'll never go back to propane again!

I wanted to get the stacking chair cover for them. The cover is really nice but it doesn’t fit real well over my chairs. It fits but it would probably fit over 10 of the chairs and I only have 4. Since it was too big for my stacking chairs, I decided to see if the cover would fit over my large wicker patio chair. It fit! This cover is large and it will fit a variety of chairs and stacking chairs.<br /><br />The material is a thick canvas material. I was really pleased with the thickness and construction of the cover. It has sewn in handles, straps that wrap around the legs and snap closed to prevent the cover from coming off during a storm.<br /><br />I've included pictures of my stacking chairs with the cover on them and the chair that I ended up using the cover on.

So the following is a comparison of the two, and a lot of information garnered from a lot of research about all things generator. I have been on a quest to eat healthy and lose weight and found Dr Joel Fuhrman’s books to be the quintessential guide to all things healthy. What does that have to do with this generator? Namely this; buying food in bulk at the peak of the growing season and freezing it is the very best way to eat the very best food at the cheapest prices year around. Between canning or more exactly using a pressure cooker in Ball Mason jars to preserve it, and more importantly freezing it captures the fresh tastes of summer. The only problem is that I have power outages every year, and in the past two years I have had to throw out more than the cost of this generator in food. Then if you spend the time to cook fresh garden veggies at their peak all of that labor is lost as well. That is not to mention the other downside of having to live without power in a storm like your sump pump stops working, and on and on and on.<br /><br />SOUND: Okay so much for the need now let's talk about the unit. I love the WEN and the Raven. After reading the reviews of some people talking about how loud they are I was more than pleasantly surprised at how quiet they are. Yes they are about the same volume as a small lawn mower. Both of these have very large mufflers and put out about the same amount of sound. So I took them and put them in my shed which is only 20 feet from my house, and then went into the house and you could not hear them. Even if you don't have a shed you can run them outside and use them during the waking hours if you have neighbors 20 feet apart like I do. At the very least run it two hours in the morning, and two hours in the evening to keep your food frozen. They also make generator sheds that you can line with sound proofing boards that are pretty cheap and come in 4'x8' sheets. However breathability having fans running and sound deadening become a challenge. You can see some pretty inventive solutions on You Tube.<br /><br />120 VS 240 VOLT: The WEN comes with a switchable 120 or 240 volt option. The Raven is a 110 only. With a 110 volt unit you get all of the juice coming through your outlet instead of it being shared between the two poles or legs of a 240. Having it all in 110 gives you more headroom. With 240 you get half the output on each leg or 1600 to 1750 per side depending on which unit we are referring to. That limits the combinations you can use. This is good to know so I am going to give you an example. Using the WEN 3500 model chart they publish typical usage of different appliances.<br />Refrigerator/freezer running watts 800 and startup 1200<br />Deep freezer 500, 500<br />Well water 1,000, 1,000<br />Furnace blower 800, 1,300.<br />So total running watts is 3100 and startup watts is 4,000.<br />Now if you have the well water and the furnace blower hooked up to one side of the 240 you would be drawing 1800 running watts and 2300 watts startup which is beyond the capacity of either leg of the 240 volt WEN. However since you can interchange breakers that are alongside one another you have the option to move them around in order to accommodate your wattage needs. (Breakers run sequentially so any 120 volt breaker has a different leg of the 240 right alongside of it.) So even set at 240 you can make it work. So if you paired up the well water at 1,000 with the deep freezer at 500 on one side, and the two 800's on the other you can make it work. However if you have a 110 volt output, you still may have to move some adjacent breakers in order to guarantee that they are all running on the one leg of your service panel but there are no limitations as long as it doesn't exceed the total capacity of the unit. Of course if you have a need for a 240 volt appliance then you either get the WEN and flip the switch to 240or get the Raven and get a step up transformer to convert to 240. That's an added expense and another box.<br />It is pretty popular with RV's to have 110 only. This Raven is built for that including having snap close covers on the outlets for more rugged use. The WEN's outlets are wide open allowing moisture to get in. Even the on-off switch in the Raven is housed in a flexible clear waterproof plastic cover whereas the WEN has an open switch. They both have 30 amp receptacles but since the WEN is switched to either 120 or 240 the outlets on the panel give you either option but not both. In plain words if you flip the switch to run 240 the output is limited to the 30 amp main feed and you can't plug anything into the two 120's on the face of the unit. The Raven however has all outlets available all of the time. So if you are running your house with it for example through the 30 amp outlet, and are using the unit in the shed, you would be able to plug a light into it using the 120 outlet even though it is actively feeding your house. So it is WEN either/or, and Raven all.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE: Both of these units started on first pull right out of the box. I put the oil in it, put about a cup of gasoline in it, opened the petcock valve to let the gas in, set the choke to full on closed, turned the switch to on, and gave it a pull. It was like turning on a photograph record. On this warm summer day it purred like a kitten and I was able to back the choke setting to full off right away. During the winter you may need to set the choke to the middle position for a bit in order to let it warm up. Do not connect your electricity to it until the motor is running stable. A chugging motor can wreak havoc on voltage levels. So you start up, smooth out, and then hook up electricity/throw on the breaker, and do the opposite when shutting down; disconnect the electricity before shutting off the generator.<br /><br />WARNINGS FOR SENSITIVE ELECTRONICS: These units provide a lot of electricity for a very reasonable amount of money. You can purchase an inverter generator for three times the money of these units and produces half of the power but they are very quiet and produce stable electricity for usage with sensitive electronics like computers, stereos, tv's and the like. They are built around an innovative inverter system, which is able to deliver higher-quality, cleaner electricity than competing generators. They produce energy in the form of pure sine waves, which are cleaner and more reliable than most commercial power sources. However motors such as those found in refrigerator freezers, furnace blowers although they prefer stable voltage they do not require it. You can buy a voltage regulator that can run a 100 dollars for a thousand watts and that will smooth out your voltage, but get a load of this, the Raven has AVR built right in. That is Automatic Voltage Regulation. To what extent it regulates the voltage as in within what kind of range I am not sure, but with one of these generators without it like the WEN it is not advisable to run sensitive electronics. I am not an expert on AVR but if I find out more information about the specifics on the Raven I will update my review. So look into it before hooking up your expensive personal electronics. Currently in the top ten sellers here at Amazon this Raven is the only one, comparably priced that comes with AVR. The two exceptions pertaining to coming with AVR are the Westinghouse WH7500E producing 7500 running watts at three times the price, and the Yamaha inverter at three times the price that is an inverter producing only 1600 watts. So the Raven sits at the top of the heap in this price range for already having AVR. It is a little bit more expensive than those without but actually a bargain considering what separate AVR's cost and then you need a separate box etc. instead of having it already built in. That makes this Raven a tiny bit larger than the WEN also. To see them side by side you would think they are the same size.<br /><br />USAGE AND TRANSFER SWITCHES: My brother has a friend who lives in a neighborhood that has frequent power outages and they last normally about 5 days. So when the power goes out the entire neighborhood has a generator outside running all of the time. Many of them simply take a 20 amp extension cord and plug it into an outlet with that breaker being connected. They ahead of time shut off the main breaker going out to the main power from the utility company, and then shut off all of the other breakers except for the essential ones they need. This is a dangerous way to use one of these units. The problem is that if someone does not know, and leaves the main breaker on that connects to the utility company, a utility worker thinks he is out there working on a utility pole that is dead, and it is instead live because of the back feed coming from your house, or feedback as they call it in the industry. It is a violation of electrical code to just hook it up that way.<br /><br />I saw a photo of someone online that had a bolted in metal plate that would not allow the breaker from the generator feed to be on with the main breaker switch on at the same time, but the best bet, and working within code is to get a transfer switch. That way there is no way to get feedback into the mains. A good one like the &#34;Reliance Controls 31406CRK Pro/Tran 6-Circuit 30 Amp Generator Transfer Switch Kit With Transfer Switch, 10-Foot Power Cord, And Power Inlet Box For Up To 7,500-Watt Generators&#34; will give you the ability to leave your generator hooked up ready to go and all you have to do is flip the center double paddle breaker to the on-generator position. There are larger ones with more available circuits feeding off of that the price goes up. There are all kinds of ingenious methods around this but be warned most of them are not bullet proof like a transfer switch. Violating electrical codes that results in a lineman getting hurt or killed could put you in a very tenable position.<br /><br />GASOLINE WITH ALCOHOL IN IT: Almost all of our available gas has 10% methanol in it and the manufactures of these generators warn you to not use gas with more than 10% in it. Even at 10% gas doesn't keep like it used to. Alcohol absorbs water so extra precautions are necessary. If you are storing it for a long time drain the fuel including what is found in the carburetor. It is a good idea to shut the petcock off for the gas feed and let the carb run dry after every use. Always put a gas storage additive in the fuel such as &#34;STA-BIL 22214 Fuel Stabilizer - 32 Fl oz.&#34; If you do store it with fuel in it try to store it full. Partially empty tanks can let air in when opening and closing the lid for example and the air has humidity in it that will get into the fuel and degrade it more quickly. Don't overfill it because fuel can expand.<br /><br />There is a certain freedom knowing that the generator is there in case of an outage, or if you need portable power somewhere. I bought a second small WEN cover in order to cover the Raven since they don't make, or at least not available on Amazon a dedicated cover. You may want to consider other options such as electric start that the Raven 6500E has and multiple WEN models.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a rationale for having two generators that would be to some kind of advantage but it was difficult. At twice the price you get one generator producing an equivalent amount of watts to the both combined. (At least in the same ballpark) The smaller generators are quieter than the bigger ones but that is made up by having two running instead of one. Having two does provide some added security in case for any reason one fails, you have the other to run essentials. You have the Raven which is meant for more exposure to the elements than the WEN, and having the option of carting around a unit this size is less weight transferring to more portability than having one big one. I guess it all depends on what your needs are. I hope you have found this review helpful. I worked hard to discover all that I could. I'm excited about running full time power out to my shed which will act as a connection when the power goes out. Hope this has been helpful.y side you would think they are the same size.<br /><br />USAGE AND TRANSFER SWITCHES: My brother has a friend who lives in a neighborhood that has frequent power outages and they last normally about 5 days.

I wasn't sure what kind of chair Amazon was talking about in the title &#34;Dining Arm Chair&#34; but I put a picture to to help you decide.<br /><br />These are the chairs that I have around my outdoor patio table, the ones you sit at when eating, etc. The Cover, is very soft and fluid, not plastic feeling at all. There was no strong odor when I took them out of the package (there were no directions, either). But Putting it over my chair was a cinch and I really enjoy how they look.

I’m a big fan of cooking shows and the chefs that cook hamburgers are always using a big dome to cook the hamburger evenly and quickly, melt cheese, and steam the buns. I’ve tried using a skillet or pot lid but they aren’t really tall enough or domed enough.  Before ordering the Cuisinart Melting Dome, I researched some other brands and options. I was convinced to order because of the construction of the Cuisinart and the fact that the Cuisinart was stainless steel while others were aluminum. I try to avoid aluminum for health reasons and I just think for durability and performance, stainless steel is far better.  When it arrived it was a little smaller than I imagined. It is exactly 9” in diameter as stated, that’s just smaller than I envisioned. It is still large enough to cover a hamburger with plenty of room.  Oddly, on the packaging that it came, it states “comfortable rubber handle”. The handle is just like it is as pictured here on Amazon’s website, it is stainless steel. The handle does get hot when using. Be sure and use an oven mitt or potholder.  I’ve used the melting dome with my Lodge cast chef's platter, gas grill, and cast iron skillet. The Dome is 9 inch in diameter so it fits right down inside my 10” cast iron skillet.  It helps hold in the heat and steam which allows the meat to cook a little faster, the cheese to melt and buns to steam. The more I've used it, the more uses I've found for it. It is wonderful just as a lid when you wouldn't normally have one like on the grill or griddle.   I've included some pictures on the cast platter, skillet, and on the grill.

review of a free product from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />This Amazon \\\\\"basics\\\\\" range grill cover is remarkably similar to Classic Accessories range of covers also available her on Amazon.<br />I wanted to do a side by side comparison specifically with the [[ASIN:B000HCNEWM Classic Accessories 73912 Veranda  Barbecue Grill Cover, Medium, 59 Inch]]<br />Firstly the 73912 was only a 59 inch cover whereas this XL basics is 72\\\\\"<br />They are both similar in material, straps, build quality, look and finish, and you may be (as I was) taken in by the material as being extremely durable and hard-wearing, which after just over a year of use I found it sadly not to be, ripped at seams, and tearing from basic weather damage.<br />I will make a side note here that is was stored on a gas grill outside all winter in Minnesota, with temperatures as low as -50F and snow, so I might be being a little harsh.<br /><br />I think overall it's a nice looking cover, I also think it's pretty inexpensive, especially considering I usually have to replace them every year. 3 stars

That makes this excellent for things like camping or going anywhere there won’t be a power supply.  You can hook two of these together for more power, but will need to purchase the appropriate cable to do so.<br /><br />Much quieter than a regular generator; probably about as noisy as running the air conditioner.  We took this camping and used it to run the air conditioner at night.  And the kids, of course, felt the need to recharge the iPad because for some reason you can’t camp without electronic devices these days.  But what’s really cool is that you don’t have to run this at full power 100% of the time.  There is a switch for it to come on only when needed; that saves on gas.<br /><br />This can be used at home in case of a power outage, but if your sump pump is running quite a bit, I don't believe that this alone would be enough to run both the sump pump and the fridge at the same time.  But we have a larger sized generator for that.<br /><br />This comes with a flat head screwdriver, small wrench, a handle you can put together to change the spark plug and battery jumper cables for your car.  It does not come with the copper grounding pipe or the suggested 12 AWG stranded copper wire that are recommended to ground the unit when using it, nor the Philips screwdriver you'll need to remove the access panel to add or check the oil.  It says it comes with a dipstick, but I don't see one and it's not a part of the cap like on my lawnmower.<br /><br />The most difficult thing about it is the weight.  Over 50 lb (before adding the gas), but that is still a lot easier and lighter than hauling around a bigger generator.<br /><br />It holds up to .37 qt of oil and 1 gallon of gas.  The first time we used it, it took 3 pulls to get it started.  Since then only 1 or 2 pulls have been necessary.

So far, I am very happy with this smoker.  It can be used at a wide range of temperatures, letting you smoke, grill, or even bake foods.  It is definitely versatile, although you may want to consider the operating cost of cooking at high temps with wood pellets -- you will burn through them rather quickly as compared to the lower settings used to smoke foods.<br /><br />My smoker arrived with the box in good shape, packed well, and with no damage during shipping.  Sometimes large, heavy packages arrive looking like they were attacked by bears, but in this case all was well.  It is very heavy.  We found it easiest to unpack the box right in the driveway, carrying the individual parts of the grill to the deck.  It still took two people to carry the main body of the smoker, but those two people were me (a 40 year old woman) and my son (age 11).  Once we had everything unpacked, I turned the assembly over to my mother in law and my son.  All of the needed parts were included and the assembly took them less than an hour.  The only problem they had was an unclear part of the directions; be sure you put the wheels on the correct side of the grill, opposite the handle.  It was easy to fix, but they didn't realize the instructions were for the model with the side shelf.<br /><br />Once the grill was assembled, we went through the process of filling the hopper and letting the wood pellets feed down to the burner.  This takes several minutes, but as long as you don't let the grill run out of pellets, you shouldn't have to do it again.<br /><br />The smoker is very sturdy and seems quite strong and well built.  The upper rack in addition to the main cooking area is a nice feature.  The wheels make it easy for one person to move.  You do need access to an outlet, so make sure you have a place where this can be plugged in.<br /><br />Performance of the smoker is good.  We had to play around with the setting that allows you to customize the speed at which pellets are fed to the burner to help keep a steady temperature.  The smoker dial was set to 225, but the digital temp reading was over 300.  The thermometer on the front of the grill, however, read a temp of 200.  That's a pretty big discrepancy.  I plan to pick up an oven thermometer to get an accurate idea of the temp next time we use the smoker.  The part of the manual that describes how to adjust the hopper feed setting isn't very clear on which setting could be best; we had to wing it.  Even still, the lamb chops, duck legs, and Italian sausage we cooked tonight were all super delicious.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great cooking tool once you have it up and running.  The flavor of smoked food is crazy good and we are honestly addicted.  I would suggest having a thermometer on hand to make sure you know what temp you are cooking at so you can accurately predict when meats will be cooked through until you get to know how your smoker operates.

In each case, the Taylor thermometer displayed temps to the nearest degree or two of the other thermometers, and that's close enough for me.<br /><br />If you need scientific, precise accuracy, be prepared to spend quite a bit more on a professional thermometer!  As it is, I believe this is a good value for a general thermometer.<br /><br />If this review has been helpful, please check Yes below.

The 80V Lithium battery pack and DigiPro Brushless motor work well together delivering all the power you could ever need at the touch of a button.  In this brief review, I will attempt to discuss the major points that make this a product you should consider for your next chainsaw.<br /><br />One of the most important reasons that I use cordless chainsaws is for their ability to operate at the click of a button without spending costly minutes preparing a gasoline engine for operation.  The loud noise and gasoline fumes also annoy me while working on my forest lands and I prefer not to deal with this.  Finally, working outdoors is often very strenuous and breathing in carbon monoxide vapors does not seem to be very healthy for the person seeking exercise.<br /><br />The GreenWorks 18” Cordless chainsaw is much lighter than similar size gas powered models.  The reduced weight has a huge impact on fatigue while carrying the chainsaw across your property.  The 80V Chainsaw also has very good balance between the front bar and back the large handles give you plenty of locations to grab onto while cutting limbs or trees at various angles.<br /><br />As a comparison, I attached several photos of this chainsaw next to the Ryobi 40V 14” cordless chainsaw.  Looking at both of these chainsaws, you should notice their size compared to the leather gloves and measuring tape.  Lithium powered chainsaws are small and easily manageable pieces of equipment.<br /><br />Yet, the comparisons end when comparing the cutting power of these two pieces of equipment.  The raw torque of the 80V motor in this GreenWork Pro product is something that the Ryobi 40V simply cannot do.  For example, we needed to remove a 75 year old 16” x 16” x 14’ Longleaf pine, oil derrick timber from my conservation land in Louisiana.  Repeated attempts to get the Ryobi to cut the timber failed because it did not have the power to drag the chain across the wood at high speed.  Using the GreenWorks 80V chainsaw was a different story, within seconds a full cut was made through the thick ancient log.  The Longleaf pine grain was very compact and had not rotted at all which showed the true strength of the GreenWorks Pro!<br /><br />The battery itself has yet to run out of power versus the numerous cuts made on small trees and large limbs over the course of an 8 hour day.  As a result, I have yet to run out of power even after not charging the cordless chainsaw for more than a month of use.  Recharging is simple task of sliding the battery into the unit and letting it go.  After less than an hour my 2AH 80V was fully charged and ready to go.  A small fan is built into the battery charger to cool the massive Lithium-Ion battery pack.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with the performance of the GreenWorks GCS80420 80V 18-Inch Cordless Chainsaw includes 2.0AH Li-Ion Battery and Charger.  My chainsaw has seen extensive duty in the forests of Louisiana with no major problems occurring that would impact my ability to use it.  I recommend it to anyone seeking a reliable chainsaw that can tackle the job of removing the occasional large tree or limb in their yard.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/5/2015:  Chainsaw still working like new.  Was able to use a full battery after cutting down a large tree.

Using the GreenWorks 80V chainsaw was a different story, within seconds a full cut was made through the thick ancient log.

While the manufacturer suggests using this to power items like a laptop and other small electronics I figured I would push this to see what it could handle and if could work on a construction site.<br /><br />Using the ESC setting the generator is very quiet and conserves the amount of gasoline used. If you are looking to use a higher amperage device turning off the ESC setting will increase the noise, but was able to power a circular saw that was rated at 15 amps. No issues and no overload light. I decided to plug in a rebar cutter and both the rebar cutter and the circular saw ran without shutting down the generator, but the overload light did come on.<br /><br />Bottom line this generator is not going to provide the ability to run a multitude of high amperage units on a construction site, but it works great if you need to use just 1-2. Great for a handyman or a smaller crew. If you are going camping you'll get great mileage from this generator.<br /><br />Overall this generator stacks up very well against the Honda EU2000i, which is also rated at 2,000 watts, and it currently runs for $700 less!

Before I ordered this, I read up on the insecticide, Bifenthrin. What I read indicated that it was highly toxic to aquatic species, but because it's barely water soluble, that's not much of a concern unless you live right near a water source-- it's mostly going to stay put right there in your soil (and not get into groundwater). I also read that it's basically harmless to humans unless you ingest it-- skin contact is no problem. And I have no pets or babies to worry about.<br /><br />BUT... I wanted to quote from that information for my review, so I searched for it again, and found this section at Toxipedia:<br /><br />&#34;Bifenthrin disrupts the nervous system and causes paralysis in insects. It has a moderate toxicity to mammals. For rats, the LD50 of females is 54mg/kg, and in males is 70mg/kg. Bifenthrin is also moderately toxic to birds. The LD50 of mallard ducks is 1280ppm, and 4450ppm for bobwhite quail. It has a very high toxicity for fish and other aquatic species. The LD50 is 0.00015 mg/l for rainbow trout, 0.00035 mg/l for bluegill, and 0.0016 mg/l for Daphnia. Bifenthrin is also toxic to non-target bees (#EXTOXNET). . . Although it does not pose a high risk for mammals and birds, bifenthrin may accumulate in the food chain and harm high-level predators.&#34;<br /><br />So... basically, I just became part of the problem in killing off bees, and potentially killed off some birds, too. I'm frustated with myself for not doing further research to begin with-- it sounded like a pretty safe insecticide for my uses, but I should have been more thorough in my reading. Which is why I'm passing along the info to you.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, bugs have only increased since I used it.

It did the job well, but took a lot of energy to use.  It was heavy, bulky, didn't move well, and was gas powered, so I always had trouble starting it on my own.<br /><br />This pressure washer is at least equivalent to the old one we have, if not better.  The pluses far outweigh the minuses...<br /><br />It is easy to move around<br />Easy to set up<br />Runs on electricity, not gas<br />Can be used for small and large projects<br /><br />So far, this has made it easy to:<br />wash car floor mats<br />wash the car<br />pressure wash moss off the driveway, patio, kids outdoor toys, etc<br /><br />I'm really loving the freedom this pressure washer gives me.

However, this is the newest model that seems to be manufactured of a heavier duty thicker vinyl and a different single piece baffled construction.  I have listed the Pros and Cons of this model (Palm Springs 4-6 person) as well as Logistics and maintenance on what you need and what is nice to have for a better experience.  As a side note, we used to have the co-branded Coleman Lay-z-spa which is equivalent to the Miami 2-4 person spa.  We sold/left it at our old house at the request of our former landlord.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ This inflatable hot tub is non-permanent and much easier to get it placed and moved where you would like it.<br />+ Low entry price makes it more affordable to have a hot tub.<br />+ 120 air jets help create a soothing massage.  Air jets are not as drying to the skin as water jets.<br />+ Inflatable vinyl-leather cover has easy to use clip-on straps, and is supposed to help prevent heat loss.<br />+ The inflatable hot tub comes with a cushioned floor mat (giant vinyl bubble-wrap) which is supposed to help with protecting the hot tub and also help with insulation. It is also more comfortable when in the hot tub.<br />+ This is a good sized hot tub that can fit 4-6.  The interior diameter is approximately 57&#34; The walls are approximately 9&#34; thick.  Lesser quality inflatable hot tubs have walls 7-8&#34; thick.<br />+ Lay-z-spa also makes a co-branded unit with Coleman based off their Miami (2-4 person) model.  This Palm Springs model is an improvement in both sturdiness and design for the inflatable part.  The motor unit and all accessories are otherwise identical.<br />+ This unit can be directly plugged into an 110v outlet.  There is no need for hardwiring.  There are 220v versions but I think that they are  primarily marketed in Europe.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The hot tub is inflatable and getting in and out could be tricky for the infirm.<br />- Hot tubs and jacuzzis are noisy.  This one is no exception.<br />- This style of hot tub is more of a sit upright type of hot tub instead of a lounging type of hot tub.  Adding ($) an inflatable pillow for neck support does make it better.<br />- The nature of inflatable hot tubs is that they are not very good insulators so expect the water to loose heat much more quickly than a regular hot tub.<br />- Inflatable hot tubs also generally don't heat the water as warm as traditional hot tubs. The Lay-z-spa is no exception and only heats to 104F (40c)<br />- Inflatables do leak air slowly, so expect to detach the hose and top-off the air every 7-14 days.  This is normal.<br />- The inflatable cover also leaks air and needs to be topped-off. Again, this is normal but nonetheless annoying.<br />- Maintenance cost and effort is similar to that of a traditional tub.<br />- Chlorine tablets are needed for the floating chemical puck are available online but not easy to find in brick and mortar shops.  These tables are also more expensive than regular chlorine.<br />- Emptying the water from the hot tub (to change water) via the garden hose drain attachment is just as slow if not slower than filling it up.  To speed up this process, additional submersible pump is needed.<br />- As the material is vinyl, there is a certain amount of off-gassing.  The scent will be more noticeable when the hot tub is heated.<br />- The safety and auto-shut of thermostat is set for the lowest external operating temperature of 40F (lower than 40F water starts to freeze).  So this Lay-z-spa is not meant for winter time use.  However the season can be extended by warming up the air around the pump with a heater to encourage it to work.  Once the water is heated, the surrounding temperature will rise slightly and help keep the pump going.<br />- It seems that the pump unit can be used for bubbles or for heat but not both at the same time.  The solution is to alternate heating andusing the bubbles.<br /><br />Logistics:<br />* The product box is 90-lbs so be prepared to have a hand truck or help moving it to where you would like to open it.<br />* The box includes: an instructional DVD, emergency patch kit, floating chemical puck, monometer, Filter (size IV).<br />* Spa chemicals are not included.<br />* Things that are nice to have on hand to start are Bestway's Chemical Starter Kit, a study step tool to help get in and out of the hot tub, a folding tray table for outside the hot tub or a floating tray for inside the hot tub for beverages and snacks and an inflatable hot tub pillow for neck support.<br />* Some sort of sturdy platform to put the Lay-z-spa on: floating deck, wood patio tiles from Ik*a, foam tiles, kitchen gel mats to help distribute the weight a little more evenly and to provide a little bit more cushion and insulation.<br />* Maintenance requires Bestway Lay-z-spa filters (size IV) that roughly need to be cleaned or replaced every 2 weeks, chemicals (bromine or chlorine), hot tub/pool scent crystals/salts to decrease the chlorine smell if it bothers you.<br />* Round patio table covers also fit the hot tub as temporary covers.<br />* Weber Smoker cover and standard chimnea covers fit the pump unit.<br />* All hot tubs take a while to heat up the water.  The Lay-z-spa takes the same amount of time to heat up the water (overnight) as a traditional spa.  Filling with warm/hot tap water will decrease the time it takes to heat the water.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is a very good inflatable hot tub.  It is built of heavier duty materials than its predecessors and competitors.  It is attractively priced and convenient to set up, take down and move.  However it does require almost as much time, effort and money for its maintenance as a regular hot tub.  There are other additional hidden costs for accessories to personalize your hot tub.  However, I would still recommend this Lay-z-spa for those that need something non-permanent.u would like to open it. * The box includes: an instructional DVD, emergency patch kit, floating chemical puck, monometer, Filter (size IV). * Spa chemicals are not included. * Things that are nice to have on hand to start are Bestway's Chemical Starter Kit, a study step tool to help get in and out of the hot tub, a folding tray table for outside the hot tub or a floating tray for inside the hot tub for beverages and snacks and an inflatable hot tub pillow for neck support. * Some sort of sturdy platform to put the Lay-z-spa on: floating deck, wood patio tiles from Ik*a, foam tiles, kitchen gel mats to help distribute the weight a little more evenly and to provide a little bit more cushion and insulation. * Maintenance requires Bestway Lay-z-spa filters (size IV) that roughly need to be cleaned or replaced every 2 weeks, chemicals (bromine or chlorine), hot tub/pool scent crystals/salts to decrease the chlorine smell if it bothers you. * Round patio table covers also fit the hot tub as temporary covers. * Weber Smoker cover and standard chimnea covers fit the pump unit. * All hot tubs take a while to heat up the water.
